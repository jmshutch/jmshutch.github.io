I was pleased to be part of the team that organized the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/news/articles/2025/05/id3a-hosts-asa-datafest-statistics-applied-learning-competition.html>first American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest at Kansas State University</a>.  A big thank you to the ID3A team, graduate student mentors, judges, and undergraduate participants for a memorable weekend!
The event was also co-sponsored by the Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences!
