Tom Baker of Esri writes about <a href="https://community.esri.com/t5/education-blog/using-generative-ai-to-write-a-map-description/ba-p/1311046">his experiment using ChatGPT with the plugin SceneXplain</a> to use AI to describe images in text.  Because a plugin is used, this approach does require upgrading your ChatGPT account from the free to a paid version.

Take a look at his map and the generative AI's resulting map description at his original blog post.  As Tom points out, the technology doesn't yet describe any patterns in the map, but does a good job identifying the content of the map.  Not bad for first-gen tech!
