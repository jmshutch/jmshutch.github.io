Here' a nice summary from Level Up Coding of <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/10-things-i-stopped-doing-in-python-after-learning-from-the-pros-f8ea00922eb6">
pro tips for coding in Python and less used alternatives for more efficient operations</a>.  Here are five of those tips that I think will help novice to intermediate level coders the most:

1. Using <code>for</code> loops When List Comprehensions are Better
2. Using <code>print</code> Statements for Debugging
3. Don't Reinvent the Wheel - Leveraging Python Libraries
4. Writing Clear and Concise Comments
5. Embracing Version Control and Git (or GitHub)

**List comprehensions** are something and still working on and need to incorporate more frequently...but I still tend to default to good old fashioned for loops!
