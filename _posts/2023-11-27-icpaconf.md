The <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/today/announcement/?id=93474">International Conference on Precision Agriculture (ICPA)</a> will be held in Manhattan, KS on July 21-24, 2024.  Don’t let the conference name trick you into thinking that this opportunity isn’t for geographers!  A quick review of possible <a href="https://www.ispag.org/icpa/AbstractTopicGroups">abstract topics</a> shows several that reflect work being done by our faculty and students, including AI in agriculture, drivers and barriers to adoption of precision ag technologies, geospatial data, remote sensing of soils and crops, social science applications within precision ag, and more…  Because KSU is a title sponsor, faculty and students whose abstracts are accepted for presentation (oral papers or posters) can take advantage of a 50% discount on registration.  The deadline for abstract submission is December 1, 2023.
