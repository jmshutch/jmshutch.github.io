Knowledge graphs are graph-structured data models used to integrate data. Knowledge graphs are often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events, situations or abstract concepts – while also encoding the semantics underlying the used terminology.  These structures can now be produced in the Esri sphere using <a href="https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/knowledge/latest/introduction/what-is-arcgis-knowledge.htm">ArcGIS Knowledge which was originally released in 2021</a>.  ArcGIS Knowledge allows you to create a knowledge graph in ArcGIS Enterprise with ArcGIS Pro. 

Check out this <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-knowledge/analytics/now-available-arcgis-knowledge/">ArcGIS Blog post</a> that introduces this new capability for graph analytics.

For those who qualify for a maintenance suscription to the Esri Academy - and this includes KSU faculty, staff, and students with an active K-State GIS Portal account - interest users can sign into an <a href="https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/647f796f9631de19e3a4954c/getting-started-with-arcgis-knowledge/">hour long seminar</a> that explains the basics of how knowledge graphs work in ArcGIS and how to load data into a graph and explore it in ArcGIS Pro.
